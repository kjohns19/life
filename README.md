# Life
I found this when going through old personal projects. I thought I'd put it on github. It's a [cellular automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) with different sets of rules, the most famous being [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

Requires g++, cmake 2.8, and SFML-2.1
